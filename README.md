# TodoList

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.0-next.1.


## Purpose

The idea is to **demonstrate how to write a typical, non-trivial CRUD application using Angular**. 


## Installation

### Platform & tools

You need to install Node.js and then the development tools. Node.js comes with a package manager called [npm](http://npmjs.org) for installing NodeJS applications and libraries.
* [Install node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) (requires node.js version >= 0.8.4)

### Get the Code

Either clone this repository or fork it on GitHub and clone your fork:

```
git clone https://github.com/pika89/todo-app.git
```

### Client App

* Install local dependencies (from the project root folder):

    ```
    npm install
    ```

  (This will install the dependencies declared in the client/package.json file)

## Running
### Development server
* Run the server

    ```
    npm start
    ```
* Browse to the application at [http://localhost:4200]


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
